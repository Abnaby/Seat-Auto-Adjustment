## Project Requirements 
### Problem statement 
Automatically adjust the seat for optimal comfort and safety based on the driver's physical characteristics.
### User needs
- Easy user interface for entering the inputs.
- Auto-positioning with less manual modifications.
- Easy feedback process after positioning.
- Comfort seat position for driving, holding the pedal, and clear vision.
### Guidelines
#### All Possible Conditions 
- If minimum average <= weight & height =< maximum average ðŸ¡ª standard seat position.

- If height <= minimum average ðŸ¡ª seat higher and further front.

- If height >= maximum average ðŸ¡ª seat lower and further back.

- If weight <= minimum average ðŸ¡ª decreased lumbar support and a slightly raised backrest.

- If weight >= maximum average ðŸ¡ª increased lumbar support and a slightly reclined backrest.
